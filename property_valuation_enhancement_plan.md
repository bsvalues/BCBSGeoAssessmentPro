# PropertyValuationAgent Enhancement Plan

## Phase 2: Washington-Specific Valuation Model Enhancement

### Current State Analysis
- The PropertyValuationAgent has a solid foundation with multiple valuation approaches
- Key valuation methods (_sales_comparison_approach, _income_approach, _cost_approach) are implemented as placeholders
- Support functions (_adjust_comparables, _reconcile_comparable_values, _calculate_confidence_score) need enhancement
- Special valuation types defined in TaxLawComplianceAgent can be leveraged

### Implementation Tasks

#### 1. Washington-Specific Sales Comparison Approach
- **RCW Reference**: RCW 84.40.030 (true and fair value)
- **Enhancements**:
  - Add neighborhood-specific adjustment factors per Washington assessing practices
  - Implement time-based sales adjustment (Washington's standard sale timeframe)
  - Add specialized consideration for waterfront/view properties (significant in WA)
  - Incorporate county-specific market adjustment factors

#### 2. Washington-Specific Income Approach
- **RCW References**: RCW 84.40.030, WAC 458-07-030
- **Enhancements**:
  - Add Washington-specific capitalization rate calculations
  - Implement different income models for various commercial property types
  - Include special considerations for leasehold interests in public property
  - Add support for special use commercial properties

#### 3. Washington-Specific Cost Approach
- **RCW Reference**: RCW 84.40.030
- **Enhancements**:
  - Implement Marshall & Swift cost valuation tables specific to Washington
  - Add location modifiers specific to Washington regions
  - Implement Washington's depreciation schedules
  - Add special considerations for functional/economic obsolescence

#### 4. Special Classification Valuation Methods
- **RCW References**: RCW 84.34 (Open Space), RCW 84.33 (Timber), RCW 84.26 (Historic)
- **Enhancements**:
  - Implement Current Use valuation for agricultural and open space lands
  - Add Designated Forest Land valuation methodology
  - Implement Historic Property special valuation
  - Add Senior/Disabled Persons exemption impact calculations

#### 5. Valuation Confidence and Quality Metrics
- **Enhancements**:
  - Implement Washington State's ratio study standards
  - Add coefficient of dispersion (COD) calculations
  - Implement price-related differential (PRD) analysis
  - Add statistical reliability measures for mass appraisal

#### 6. Integration with GIS and Spatial Analysis
- **Enhancements**:
  - Incorporate neighborhood delineation factors
  - Add flood zone and environmental factors specific to WA
  - Implement view assessment quantification
  - Add Census and demographic correlations

### Testing Strategy
- Create unit tests for each valuation approach
- Implement end-to-end tests for complete property valuation
- Add regression tests comparing against known WA assessment results
- Implement ratio study testing for mass appraisal

### Implementation Priority
1. Sales Comparison Approach (highest priority - most commonly used in WA)
2. Special Classification Methods (high importance for compliance)
3. Cost Approach (important for new construction)
4. Income Approach (critical for commercial properties)
5. Confidence Metrics (important for internal quality assurance)
6. GIS Integration (enhances accuracy across methods)
